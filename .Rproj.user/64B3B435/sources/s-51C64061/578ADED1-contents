# PROJECT PLAN

Target: Receiving a bid to the NCAA tournament over time

Predictors: Good wins, bad losses, probability of winning tournament, how many teams are above them



Data: hoopR and wehoop
- load_schedule functions have game by game results
- finding tournament seeds will be tough, might need to take the L and do so manually? Or scrape somewhere and hope that most of the names join nicely, clean up ones that do not.
- There should be one observation per team per day

These are all pretty important ^
