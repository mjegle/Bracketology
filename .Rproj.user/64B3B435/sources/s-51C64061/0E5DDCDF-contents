##### FIND OFFENSIVE RATING #######
# Problem: No possession ID which means we can't find the number of possessions per game as of right now
# Need to find the number of possessions on our own
# How can a possession end?
# 1. Made shot
# 2. Missed shot & defensive rebound
# 3. Turnover/offensive foul
# 4. End of period

# Need to use an estimate for now. Obviously has some drawbacks since it's not precise but it could be a blessing in disguise
# since now we can get # of possessions for games for which pbp data is not available
